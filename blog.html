    Transmission Log 01

Recorder: Theo Ward
Assignment: Deep-Range Cartographic Survey
Vessel Status: Operational
Signal Integrity: 84%
  </pre>

<p>
This is Theo Ward, initiating routine transmission in accordance with Deep-Range Protocols.

Current position is unresolved. Navigation systems are unable to correlate stellar reference data with any known charted volume. Multiple solution attempts return null relations. Error states have been ruled out. Instruments are functioning within expected tolerances.

I am alone.

The vessel remains structurally sound. Life-support systems are stable. Power reserves are sufficient for extended operation. No external damage is detected. There are no immediate survival threats. I am documenting this explicitly to prevent assumption bias in future review.

Estimated distance from origin exceeds eighteen thousand stellar spans. This figure is derived from residual translation data and may be inaccurate. The uncertainty is significant enough to render return projections nonviable. All calculated vectors fail to intersect known space.

A high-gain return transmission has been issued. Due to signal decay over distance, response is not expected within any meaningful timeframe. I will continue periodic broadcasts as required, despite the statistical improbability of receipt.

Environmental observations: the local starfield does not conform to predicted distribution models. Spectral variation is unusually uniform. Gravitational background noise is present but stable. There is no apparent hazard, which is… notable. I am withholding interpretation until additional data is collected.

I am experiencing elevated cognitive load consistent with prolonged isolation and unresolved threat conditions. No impairment is detected. Sleep cycles remain regular. Manual tasks are proceeding without error. This statement is included because I am aware that fear often manifests first as denial.

There was no observable malfunction preceding the translation event. Mission logs indicate nominal operation until discontinuity. The absence of causative data is troubling. I have reviewed the logs three times and will likely review them again.

This transmission is classified as routine. That classification feels incorrect, but procedure requires it.

I will maintain survey operations. I will continue documentation. I will adhere to protocol for as long as adherence remains possible.

End transmission.
