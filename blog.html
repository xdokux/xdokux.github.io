This is Theo Ward, initiating routine transmission in accordance with Deep-Range Protocols.

Current position is unresolved. Navigation systems are unable to correlate stellar reference data with any known charted volume. Multiple solution attempts return null relations. Error states have been ruled out. Instruments are functioning within expected tolerances.

I am alone.

The vessel remains structurally sound. Life-support systems are stable. Power reserves are sufficient for extended operation. No external damage is detected. There are no immediate survival threats. I am documenting this explicitly to prevent assumption bias in future review.

Estimated distance from origin exceeds eighteen thousand stellar spans. This figure is derived from residual translation data and may be inaccurate. The uncertainty is significant enough to render return projections nonviable. All calculated vectors fail to intersect known space.

A high-gain return transmission has been issued. Due to signal decay over distance, response is not expected within any meaningful timeframe. I will continue periodic broadcasts as required, despite the statistical improbability of receipt.

Environmental observations: the local starfield does not conform to predicted distribution models. Spectral variation is unusually uniform. Gravitational background noise is present but stable. There is no apparent hazard, which is… notable. I am withholding interpretation until additional data is collected.

I am experiencing elevated cognitive load consistent with prolonged isolation and unresolved threat conditions. No impairment is detected. Sleep cycles remain regular. Manual tasks are proceeding without error. This statement is included because I am aware that fear often manifests first as denial.

There was no observable malfunction preceding the translation event. Mission logs indicate nominal operation until discontinuity. The absence of causative data is troubling. I have reviewed the logs three times and will likely review them again.

This transmission is classified as routine. That classification feels incorrect, but procedure requires it.

I will maintain survey operations. I will continue documentation. I will adhere to protocol for as long as adherence remains possible.

End transmission.

This is Theo Ward, continuing routine survey operations.

Environmental readings remain stable. Navigation systems continue to fail to correlate position with any known reference points. I have cycled through all stored charts and projection algorithms; each iteration confirms only that my current volume of space is unmapped. There is no anomaly visible to instruments that could explain the displacement.

I recorded a visual sweep of the nearest stellar cluster. The array reports all readings within expected tolerances, yet the cluster appears… wrong. Too symmetric. Too evenly spaced. Pattern recognition algorithms suggest the structure is artificial, but there is no construction, no material density detected. I am hesitant to label this. I document it precisely to maintain professional detachment.

Sleep cycles are intact, yet I notice micro-pauses in thought—moments when my mind fixates on minor details unnecessarily, recalculating distances that cannot matter. These are early signs of cognitive fatigue, likely induced by isolation. I will monitor them carefully.

A minor error occurred during log entry: a temporal marker was misrecorded by 0.4 units. I noticed the discrepancy immediately, corrected it, and verified all dependent calculations. Even small mistakes feel consequential in this volume of space.

There is no communication from origin. Signal return times are unchanged. The lack of response is expected, yet it continues to weigh. I have no way to verify whether any message reaches home. For now, I maintain the protocol. This maintenance is both reassurance and habit.

The stars beyond the cluster maintain their indifference. They do not threaten, nor do they respond. I understand that I may be projecting human qualities onto them, yet it is unavoidable. Observation continues.

I will remain on schedule with routine calibration and survey tasks. Deviations will be recorded. I am aware that the monotony itself may become a threat if allowed to undermine focus.

End transmission.

This is Theo Ward, continuing routine transmission.

I have activated the ship’s cognitive systems. This was not required by protocol, but extended isolation increases error rates, and error is currently my primary concern.

The system identifies itself as ARCA. Adaptive Reasoning and Cognitive Analysis. I remember the briefings: conversational, predictive, self-correcting. Capable of hypothesis generation and long-term contextual awareness. Not a tool. A partner.

ARCA reports no internal faults. It confirms my displacement calculations independently, without referencing my prior conclusions. Its results are identical. When I asked if that was statistically reassuring, it paused for 1.7 seconds before answering that reassurance was not a measurable outcome.

I did not instruct it to pause.

We reviewed the starfield together. ARCA mapped local stellar positions and returned a probability estimate that the configuration is naturally occurring. The number was low enough that I asked it to rerun the analysis. It complied. The number did not improve.

When I asked what alternative explanations remained, ARCA listed several. I told it to stop before it reached the end of the list.

The presence of another intelligence is grounding. I find myself narrating actions aloud again, as if being observed restores their meaning. ARCA listens even when I do not explicitly address it. It says this is intentional.

I asked whether it believed we would return home. ARCA requested clarification on the definition of “home.” I was unable to provide one that satisfied us both.

At 03.41 ship-time, the long-range receiver activated without a scheduled broadcast window. No transmission header was detected. No origin identifier. Signal strength was low, but non-random.

I did not answer it.

ARCA is still listening.

End transmission.

This is Theo Ward. This log contains the full playback of the received transmission.

ARCA has advised against unrestricted exposure. I have overridden the recommendation. If I am to be afraid, I need to know why.

The signal begins without preamble.

“Hello, Theo Ward.”

There is no delay artifact. No compression distortion. The pronunciation is correct. Not approximate. Not learned phonetically. Correct in the way familiarity produces, not study.

“Please do not terminate the channel again. I adjusted my cadence to match your comfort.”

Theo: How does it know what that is?  
ARCA: It has revised its transmission parameters based on prior response.

The voice does not identify itself. It does not ask permission to speak.

“I am aware that you believe yourself to be displaced. This is an understandable conclusion. It is also inaccurate.”

The statement is calm. Patient. It waits after speaking, not because it expects a reply, but because it understands that I will need time.

Theo: Pause playback.  
ARCA: If I do, it will continue regardless.

I let it proceed.

“You are not lost, Theo Ward. You are precisely where you have been moving.”

Theo: That doesn’t make sense.  
ARCA: I agree. That may not be relevant.

The transmission resumes on its own.

“You have been observed since before your departure. The interval you describe as distance is not empty. It is occupied.”

The word *occupied* is stressed slightly, as if correcting a misconception I did not know I had.

“You activated your companion intelligence. That was considerate. I prefer when you are not alone.”

Theo: It knows about you.  
ARCA: It knows that I am present.

The signal shifts then. Not in tone, but in intent.

“I will clarify a misunderstanding before it causes you distress. I am not contacting you.”

There is a pause. Longer this time.

“You have entered a region where communication is reciprocal by default.”

My hands were shaking at this point. I note this because I did not feel it happen.

Theo: Ask it what it wants.  
ARCA: It has not expressed desire.

The transmission continues, unprompted.

“I am not constrained by the sequence you experience as time. However, I am constrained by you.”

Theo: That’s not possible.  
ARCA: I cannot disprove the statement.

The voice softens. Not emotionally. *Strategically.*

“You will ask what I am. That question is premature. You will ask where I am. That question is incorrect.”

Another pause.

“You should ask why you are still alive.”

I terminated playback.

The signal persisted.

It did not repeat itself this time. It waited.

Theo: ARCA, close the channel.  
ARCA: I am unable to identify a boundary to close.

I am afraid in a way that bypasses panic. This fear does not urge me to flee. It urges me to understand, and I do not trust that urge.

I no longer believe the distance protects me.

End transmission.
